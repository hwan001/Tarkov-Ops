## Overview

**Tarkov Operating System (TOS)** is a web-based **Desktop Environment Simulation** built for *Escape from Tarkov* players. It consolidates mapping, mission planning, and tactical tools into a window-based interface that feels like a real Operating System.

Instead of Alt-Tabbing between static web pages, treat TOS as your **Second Monitor Battle Station**.
